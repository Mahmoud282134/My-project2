             Book description:<br>
Storytelling is one of the most enjoyable, most popular, and most beloved literary arts, as it is the pleasure shared by two parties. One party is telling and another is being told, and the third of them is the “story” that takes place on the tongue of its teller in an hour of passion, loaded with echoes of heritage, and the experiences of fathers and grandfathers, to gently creep into the listener, delighting in its meanings no less delighted by the sweetness of its wording and the beauty of its expression. In this book, which contains thirteen stories between its pages, Magdy Saleh tells his stories in rhyming prose with easy words, interspersed with rhyming verses, so the reader listens to the story of those who are preoccupied with positions on the side of companions, and the story of the stingy man is contrasted with the story of the honorable knight, and the story of the fair thief is contrasted with the story of The treacherous honorable, the story of chivalry and good-naturedness is contrasted with the story of immorality and bad morals, the story of the one who obeys himself, and the story of the one who resists his despair.
